# SwapChan

**Best-price same-chain and cross-chain crypto swap routing — as an MCP server, with an anime cast.** 🎌

SwapChan fans out a single swap request to LI.FI, 0x, CoW, Velora, Across, Relay, Jupiter, KyberSwap, 1inch, deBridge and THORChain at once, ranks every route by net USD after gas and fees, and returns an **unsigned** transaction for the winner. It never signs, never holds keys or funds, and never controls your money — your wallet signs. The optional `broadcast_tx` only relays a transaction you already signed locally, unchanged, to 51 chains (EVM, Bitcoin and its forks, Solana, Tron, XRP, Stellar, Algorand, Cosmos Hub, Polkadot, TON, Cardano); it can't alter it. 15 networks, same-chain and cross-chain.

## See it work

Your agent asks in plain English → SwapChan fans out to every router, ranks by net USD after gas, and hands back an **unsigned** transaction. Your wallet signs.

### find_money: paste your addresses, get your money back

Paste wallet addresses into your agent → `find_money` scans every chain and contract the wallet touched, ranks what's recoverable, and builds **unsigned** recovery txs (unwrap, withdraw, redeem) plus one swap-to-USDC link. Results are cached for 3 minutes and carry `asOf`, `block` and `cached`; pass `fresh` (`fresh=1` on `/onchain/money`, rate-limited per address) to re-scan. If a source times out, the result has `partial: true` and `incompleteSources`, the headline says totals are a lower bound, and it is cached for only about 20 seconds. Real numbers from a live run on vitalik.eth, plus an archive replay of a real P3D recovery.

Coverage goes beyond EVM: Solana, Tron, Bitcoin, Bitcoin forks and old coins (BCH, BTG, LTC, DOGE and FTC, DASH, DGB, RVN, VTC, VIA, QTUM, MONA, BSV, GRS, PPC, NVC, CLAM, RDD, BLK, Zcash transparent (t1), TRC, AUR, XPM and QRK), each with an unsigned sweep you sign offline in the coin's own wallet (old-coin sweeps are offered only after a Rust/WASM transaction library has built and verified them and an independent second decode agrees), and balances on XRP, XLM, ALGO, ATOM (Cosmos Hub), DOT, TON, ADA and Signum. Exits from liquidity and Pendle positions carry live-quoted minimums and a 20-minute deadline. Short links use unguessable ids.

Lost the wallet app but still have the phrase, keystore or key? `recovery_guide` (and [swapchan.com/recover](https://swapchan.com/recover)) walks you through deriving your **public** addresses offline with [blocktools](https://github.com/TSavo/blocktools) ([v0.3.2 release](https://github.com/TSavo/blocktools/releases/tag/v0.3.2): Linux x86_64 only, check it with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`; other systems build from source), e.g. `seed-to-master < seed.txt | derive --preset scan-js --address-list > addresses.txt`, then pasting addresses.txt into `find_money_batch`. Your seed and keys never leave your machine; SwapChan never sees them.

## Use it as an MCP server

Hosted, keyless, zero setup:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http swapchan https://mcp.swapchan.com/mcp
```

Any MCP client, via stdio bridge:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swapchan": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.swapchan.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Earn 5 bp as an agent builder

Register a partner id with your payout address and pass `partner` to `get_quote` / `compare_routes` (REST: `&partner=<id>`). You earn half of SwapChan's 0.1% fee on every swap with a verified fee:

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.swapchan.com/partners -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"My Agent","siteUrl":"https://github.com/me/my-agent","evmAddress":"0xYourPayoutAddress"}'
```

Returns `id`, a private dashboard `token` and `dashboardUrl`. Sites can embed the [widget](https://swapchan.com/widget) or use `?ref=<id>` links. Details: [swapchan.com/partners](https://swapchan.com/partners).

### Networks

Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Linea, Scroll — plus Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash (15 networks). Same-chain and cross-chain. Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash swap through THORChain only, in both directions. Payout and refund addresses are checked by blocktools. To send them you either get an unsigned PSBT (built and checked by blocktools: THORChain vault, exact amount, memo, change back to you, no RBF, fee cap) that you sign in your own wallet, or a THORChain deposit address with the exact amount, the required memo, the minimum and the expiry (not from an exchange: exchanges cannot add the memo). Progress is tracked read-only by txid.

### Open by design

SwapChan's MCP server is keyless on purpose. It's per-IP rate-limited, slippage-capped, and `build_swap_tx` only ever returns an **unsigned** transaction — the server has no keys, never signs, and never moves funds. Try it with zero setup.

## Develop

Monorepo (pnpm + turbo):

```
apps/api      Hono quote service (fan-out to providers, rank, build tx, status)
apps/web      Next.js App Router + wagmi/viem + Reown AppKit + Tailwind
apps/mcp      MCP server (get_quote etc.) on top of apps/api
packages/shared  zod types + HTTP contract (see packages/shared/README.md)
```

### Run

```sh
nvm use            # Node 24 LTS
corepack enable    # pnpm 10
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill keys
pnpm dev           # api :8787, web :3000, mcp :8788/mcp (anonymous in dev)
pnpm -F @swapchan/mcp e2e   # live MCP smoke against the running stack
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
```
